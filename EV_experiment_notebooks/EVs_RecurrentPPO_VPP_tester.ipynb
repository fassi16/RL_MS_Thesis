Main optimization objectives of the VPP are: Valley filling, peak shaving and zero resulting load over time. Main action performed to reach objectives are: storage of Renewable energy resources and power push in the grid at high demand times. The development of the Virtual Power Plant environment is based on the ELVIS (Electric Vehicles Infrastructure Simulator) open library from DAI-Labor: https://github.com/dailab/elvis The thesis code is currently available at: (https://github.com/francescomaldonato/RL_VPP_Thesis)\n","\n","Author: Francesco Maldonato\n","\n","## VPP experiment tester Notebook based on EVs arrival, with
